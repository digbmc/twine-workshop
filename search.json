    "text": "How To\nUse this guide to make a few basic customizations. There are many more you can find in the Harlowe Documentation and the Twine Cookbook.\n\nLink between passages\n\nLink syntax uses double brackets: [[passage name]]\nIf you want to display text other than the passage name: [[continue your adventure|passage name]]\n\n\n\nStyle your text\nHarlowe uses macros to style text, following this basic syntax:\n(text-style:\"fade-in-out\")[This text blinks]\n\n(color:magenta)[This text is magenta]\n\n(text-rotate-z:90)[This text is rotated 90 degrees]\n\n(bg:green)[This text has a green background]\n\n(font:\"courier\")[This text uses a different font]\n\n(text-size:0.5)[This text is smaller than other text]\n\n(align:\"=&gt;&lt;=\")+(box:\"X\")[This text is centered]\nFor style that will refer to the entire passage, use an open bracket at the end:\n(color:cyan)[=\n    The rest of the passage will be cyan\nMacros can be nested inside other macros. To include two macros that apply to the same passage, use a + between them:\n(color:green)+(font:\"courier\")[This text has two style macros applied]\nYou can also style the entire page using “enchant” macros:\n(enchant:?page,(bg:lime))\n\nColor and Font options\n\nColors\n\nTwine supports a few colors without quotation marks – you’ll find these as options in the Editor.\nYou can also use any of the CSS named colors by putting the name in quotation marks: (bg:\"blueviolet\").\nYou can also use hex values to specify a color: (text-color: #cce6ff)[This is a hex value color].\n\nFonts\n\nTwine supports basic websafe fonts that are well-supported across browsers.\nIt is also possible to load Google Fonts following these instructions, though this requires using CSS.\n\n\n\n\n\nHide and show content\n\nLink macros can create clickable text that gets replaced by other text (link:\"Click me to reveal\")[This text is revealed]\nYou can display another passage within a passage (useful if you want to repeat bits of code): (show:\"passage\")\nTo go to another passage: (go-to:\"passage\")\nTo display text after a delay: (after:1s)[Wait one second before displaying this]\nYou can create a passage that unveils slowly by embedding choices within choices:\n\nYou are going down (link: \"a passageway\")[an extremely long passageway]\nDo you want to turn left?\n(link:\"yes, let's turn left\")[You turn left and the hallway goes on (link:\"forever\")[for what feels like forever]\nNext you have the option to go (link:\"right\")[right, \nwhich you take, and then you find yourself at another (link: \"fork\")[fork. \nDo you go left or right?\n(link:\"Left\")[You've reached a dead end.]\n(link:\"Right\")[You've reached your destination!]]]]\n\nYou can also create a pop-up that will display before page content: (dialog:[Welcome to my game!],\"OK\")\n\n\n\nIntroduce variety\n\nUse ‘either’ to randomly select a value from a list: The sky is (either:\"blue\", \"pink\", \"orange\", \"green\")\nUse ‘random’ to generate random numbers: Rolling six-sided die: (random: 1,6)\n\n\n\nSet and change variables\n\nTo set a variable: (set: $name to \"Alice\")\nTo display a variable: Hello, $name\nYou can also get user input and store it in a variable: What's your name? (input:2bind $name,\"X\",\"\")\nTo use the variable on the same passage, use a prompt for this: (set: $name to (prompt: [What's your name?], \"Name\"))\nVariables can also hold numbers: (set: $score to 1)\nAnd you can do math on them: (set: $score to it + 1)\n\n\n\nUse conditionals\nConditional syntax can use variables to introduce game-like elements,\n(if: $score &gt; 10)[You win!!]\n(else:)[You lose.]\n(if: $door is \"locked\")[Sorry, the door is locked]\n(else:)[(go-to:\"door\")]\n\n\nNavigation\nTo include some text or code on every page, create a passage and give it the “header” tag. It will automatically appear at the beginning of each passage. You can also use the “footer” tag to put it at the end of each passage.\nBecause Twine is designed for games, there isn’t much built-in navigation. It can be helpful to use a header or footer to link to a page with more navigation links or guides if a player gets lost."
