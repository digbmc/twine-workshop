## Getting started with Twine

### About [Twine](https://twinery.org/)

- Twine is an open-source tool for creating interactive fiction, text-based games, and hypertext narratives
- Twine has a no-code editor that uses simple markup, shows connections between passages as a network, and can be used in browser or as a standalone application
- Twine games are stored in a markup language called [Twee](https://twinery.org/cookbook/terms/terms_twee.html) and can be edited in a text editor
- Twine is designed to emphasize interactivity (user-input, randomness, variables)
- Story format options change syntax and functionality
	- **Harlowe** - default format (this what we are using for this workshop).
	- Other options: Chapbook (beginner-friendly), SugarCube, Snowman (advanced)

### To create a story in Twine
1. Navigate to [https://twinery.org/](https://twinery.org/)
2. Click 'Use in your browser'
3. In the top-left corner, click `+ New` to create a new story. Give yours a name
4. The editor has an overall map with a single passage -- double click to edit
5. Enter some text and rename your passage
6. Click `Test From Here` to preview your game in a new tab

### Basics
- Link to a new passage using double square brackets `[[pasage name]]`
- Use hash marks to create headers: `# Header 1` and `## Header 2`
- Use `**` for `**bold**` and `*` for `*italic*`
- Use the WYSIWYG editor for other types of customizations

### Vocabulary

- **Markup** - How data is structured, displayed, and organized (general term)
- **Story** - A Twine project (i.e. a website, game, or book)
- **Passage** - A contained section of a Twine story (a page or "node" in the network)
- **Macro** - A bit of code used to change functionality or style of text, indicated with parentheses
- **Hook** - The passage of text that a macro acts on, indicated with square brackets
`(font: "Arial")[This text will be in Arial.]`
- **Variable** - A container for values and words that can change within the game
`(set: $myName to "Alice") Hello, $myName!`  

### Tips

- Preview/test your work often to make sure everything works
- When using the browser editor, export your game every time you are finished
- Create an outline or storyboard before you try to build complex functionality
- To check your story format: from the story editor, select 'Details' and select 'Harlowe 3.3.9'

## How To

Use this guide to make a few basic customizations. There are many more you can find in the [Harlowe Documentation](https://twine2.neocities.org/) and the [Twine Cookbook](https://twinery.org/cookbook/).

### Link between passages

- Link syntax uses double brackets: `[[passage name]]` 

- If you want to display text other than the passage name: `[[continue your adventure|passage name]]`

### Style your text

Harlowe uses macros to style text, following this basic syntax:

```markdown
(text-style:"fade-in-out")[This text blinks]

(color:pink)[This text is pink]

(text-rotate-z:90)[This text is rotated 90 degrees]

(bg:green)[This text has a green background]

(color:green)+(font:"courier")[This text has two style macros applied]
```

For style that will refer to the entire passage, use an open bracket at the end:

```markdown
(color:cyan)[=
    The rest of the passage will be cyan

```

You can also style the entire page using "enchant" macros:

`(enchant:?page,(bg:lime))`

### Hide and show content

- Link macros can create clickable text that gets replaced by other text
  `(link:"Click me to reveal")[This text is revealed]`
- You can display another passage within a passage (useful if you want to repeat bits of code): `(show:"passage")`
- To go to another passage: `(go-to:"passage")`
- To display text after a delay:
  `(after:1s)[Wait one second before displaying this]`
- You can create a passage that unveils slowly by embedding choices within choices:

```markdown
You are going down (link: "a passageway")[an extremely long passageway]
Do you want to turn left?
(link:"yes, let's turn left")[You turn left and the hallway goes on (link:"forever")[for what feels like forever]
Next you have the option to go (link:"right")[right, 
which you take, and then you find yourself at another (link: "fork")[fork. 
Do you go left or right?
(link:"Left")[You've reached a dead end.]
(link:"Right")[You've reached your destination!]]]]
```

- You can also create a pop-up that will display before page content:
`(dialog:[Welcome to my game!],"OK")`

### Introduce variety

- Use 'either' to randomly select a value from a list:
`The sky is (either:"blue", "pink", "orange", "green")`

- Use 'random' to generate random numbers:
`Rolling six-sided die: (random: 1,6)`

### Set and change variables

- To set a variable: `(set: $name to "Alice")`

- To display a variable: `Hello, $name`

- You can also get user input and store it in a variable:
`What's your name? (input:2bind $name,"X","")`

- To use the variable on the same passage, use a prompt for this:
`(set: $name to (prompt: [What's your name?], "Name"))`

- Variables can also hold numbers:
`(set: $score to 1)`

- And you can do math on them:
`(set: $score to it + 1)`

### Use conditionals

Conditional syntax can use variables to introduce game-like elements,

``` html
(if: $score > 10)[You win!!]
(else:)[You lose.]
```

``` html
(if: $door is "locked")[Sorry, the door is locked]
(else:)[(go-to:"door")]
```

### Navigation

To include some text or code on every page, create a passage and give it the "header" tag. It will automatically appear at the beginning of each passage. You can also use the "footer" tag to put it at the end of each passage.

Because Twine is designed for games, there isn't much built-in navigation. It can be helpful to use a header or footer to link to a page with more navigation links or guides if a player gets lost.


## Publishing guide

A twine game can be deployed to a web server so that others can play the game. There are many options for webhosting services -- here are a few that are free to you:

- Bryn Mawr: **Domain of One's Own** - [digital.brynmawr.edu](https://digital.brynmawr.edu/)
- Haverford: **Haverford Sites** - [sites.haverford.edu](https://sites.haverford.edu/) 
- GitHub Pages - [github.com](https://github.com/) - see [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) (free with GitHub account)

### Export your game from Twine
- From the Twine top menu, go to **Build** -> **Publish to File** to export your game as html
- Open it in a browser app to play it locally
- Note on Filenames:
  - By default, the filename of your game will include the title
  - Edit the filename so it has no spaces in it - this will be part of your URL
  - *Pro tip*: change the filename to `index.html`

### Deployment using DoOO or Haverford Sites

- Navigate to [digital.brynmawr.edu](https://digital.brynmawr.edu/) or [sites.haverford.edu](https://sites.haverford.edu/) and click on "Get Started" to log in
  - If you haven't already, choose a domain name that is relatively short and unique to you
- Upload your game:
  - From your Dashboard, locate the "File Manager"
  - Navigate to the folder called "public_html"
  - Create a new sub-folder called "game"
  - Upload your game to the "game" folder
- Navigate to your game's URL
  - Your game should now be public at **yourdomain.digital.brynmawr.edu/game/filename.html**
  - If you changed the filename to index, your url will be **yourdomain.digital.brynmawr.edu/game**
